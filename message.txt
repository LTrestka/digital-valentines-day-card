It's hard to leave the house these days
So I couldn't get a card
But I wanted to do something special...
So I did something kinda hard
I made a little webpage
Wrote it line by line
And placed a bunch of pics of me
So you be like 'Damn, he fine'
Although it isn't paper
And I didn't get you wine
I made you this to say I love you
And later we will dine
This last year has been pretty crazy
We really did a lot
We took a trip and had a kid
Easy? I think not!
But through it all, we had a blast
Together, you and I
...So now that you know what I did all day...
Will you be my valentine?
